Java has 2 output stream: standard (out) and error (err)
	-out: is buffered type, it will print when strings are all concatenated
	-err: print immediately when errors happend

Object hiearrchy
-Object
	-Throwable (can throw anything like this in catch from try-catch)
		-Exception
			-RuntimeException
				-ArithmeticException
				-NullPointerException
				-(Array)IndexOutOfBoundsException
				-IllegalArgumentException
			-IOException
				-FileNotFoundException
		-Error

-Error, RuntimeException (ArithmeticException, NullPointer, IllegalArgumentException,...) are UNCHECKED exception
-Exception, IOException, FileNotFoundException are CHECKED exception, which requires us to find a way to deal with that exception
