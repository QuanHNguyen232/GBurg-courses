## HW-1

Graded: 13 / 14
Completion: 6 / 6
Total: 19 / 20 = 95%

1.1.13: 2 / 2

1.2.4: 1.5 / 2: The set $\{2,2,2,2\}$ has one element since every element of a set is unique. In other words, $\{2,2,2,2\} = \{2\}$.

1.2.8: 2 / 2

1.3.4: 2 / 2: Note that $-6$ is not in $H$.

1.3.20: 2 / 2

2.1.13: 2 / 2

2.1.45: 1.5 / 2: By definition, to prove that two statements are equivalent, one should reduce the statements to their logical forms and verify that the forms themselves are logically equivalent. You can use a truth table or table 2.1.1, for example, to do this.

## HW-2

2.2.27: 2 / 2

2.2.43: 2 / 2

2.3.9: 2 / 2

2.3.28: 2 / 2

2.4.12: 2 / 2

2.4.32: 1.5/ 2: You're most of the way! Now you need to build the circuit based on the logical expression you derived.

3.1.24: 2 / 2

## HW-3

Completion: 6 / 6

2.5.30: 2 / 2

2.5.34: 2 / 2

3.2.3: 2 / 2

3.2.21: 1.5 / 2:"not divisible by 2 OR not divisible by 3."

3.2.44: 0 / 2: $\neg (happy \rightarrow largeIncome) = \neg (largeIncome \lor \neg happy) = ...$

3.3.12: 2 / 2

3.3.43: 1.5/ 2: There shouldn't be logical connectives (like OR and AND) between the quantifiers. There exists epsilon $> 0$ such that for all delta  $> 0...$

## HW-4

Completion: 6 / 6
Total: 18 / 20

3.4.27: 2 / 2

4.1.19: 2 / 2

4.1.36: 1 / 2: Why do you state that $51 > 1$? Consider your claim: $rs = p \rightarrow r = p$ OR $s$. What if $r=1$ and $s=p$? It seems like you're trying to encode too much into formal logic here. Formal logic is a tool, not a necessity. Idea: $3(2n^2 + 9)$ can be prime if and only if $2n^2 + 9$ is $1$. Which it can't be. Write this carefully using informal language, and resort to formal language where it is appropriate.

4.2.18: 2 / 2: Your first "known" claim is that the sum of rationals is rational, but then you go on to prove it. It's best to leave this first bullet point out. It then suffices to say that ad+bc is integer values and 2bd is non-zero integer valued.

4.3.13: 2 / 2

4.6.7: 2 / 2: What if $b = -1$? Then we're dividing by zero. (Just take a, b to be positive since $M$ is positive.)

4.6.20: 1 / 2: Contrapositve: $\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P$. You can not choose values for $m$ and $n$. They must be arbitrary values that satisfy the hypothesis that they're both $\geq 25$.

Total: 16.5 / 20

4.4.19: 2 / 2

4.4.22: 0.5 / 2: We're looking at c/15, for which there are infinitely many cases. Rather than proof by exhaustion, we should be using the "generalizing from the particular" method.

4.8.15: 2 / 2

4.8.27: 1.5 / 2 The second part of this proof should begin with "Assume $a|b$", or something equivalent. From the way this is written, I am led to believe we are assuming $lcm(a,b)=b$ which was the hypothesis of the previous part.

5.1.50: 2 / 2

5.1.61: 1.5 / 2: If you stopped at the third line, this would be correct. I'm unsure of how you obtained line 4.

5.1.79: 1 / 2: When you begin your explanation after factoring $p$ out of the expression, please provide a quick statement about what you're next _trying to do_. I.e. show that the denominator does not have a factor of $p$. The argument is: both $r$ and $p-r$ are strictly less than $p$, and so contain no factors of $p$ since $p$ if the least non-negative integer which is divisible by $p$.

Missing 5.4.26 - Come see me to discuss the solution.

5.2.7: 2 / 2

5.2.17: 2 / 2

5.3.15: 2 / 2

5.3.31: 2 / 2

5.4.9: 1.5 / 2: The inductive hypothesis is for $k \geq 2$. The last line of your proof is not obvious. Try factoring out $\left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^{k-1}$ from the right hand side and proceeding.

5.4.19: 0.5 / 2

But what is the issue with the proof? Notice that the base case is $k = 0$, but in the inductive step, the author applies the inductive hypothesis to $r^{k-1}$, which (for $k = 0$) could possibly be $r^{-1}$. This is _below_ the base case.

5.4.24: 1.5 / 2: There's no need to fix $m$ here. What is $t$? This is the point where I become confused, but it looks like you have the general idea of how to proceed. Please be careful with only using variables that are defined in your work.

## HW-7
Graded: 11.5/ 14
Completion: 6 / 6
Total: 17.5 / 20

5.6.14: 2 / 2: In the induction step, the $n$ should be $k$.

5.6.19: 2 / 2: The solution is missing the first macro-step of moving the top $k-2$ disks so that you have access to the two largest disks. You later state that this is needed though.

5.6.31: 1.5 / 2: Note that $2^k + 2^{k-1} < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k+1}$

5.6.43: 1.5 / 2: The induction hypothesis is that the claim holds for _some_ fixed $k > 0$. Note that in the inductive step, you do not use the induction hypothesis. It is understood that you can argue that this claim is true without induction, but the exercise is to _use_ induction. What one should do here is rewrite the product from $i=1$ to $k+1$ as a product from $i=1$ to $k$ (times some single additional factor). Apply the inductive hypothesis here.

6.1.13: 2 / 2

6.1.23: 1.5 / 2: Careful. The interval $(-1, 1)$ does not equal the interval $[-1, 1]$.

6.1.33: 1 / 2: $P( P( null ) ) = P( {null} ) = { null, {null} }$, and similarly for part (c).

6.2.10: 1.5 / 2: As written, you have demonstrated that one of the sets is a subset of the other. You should prove the other direction as well. Note that your work is _technically_ reversible (that is, the lines of your proof are iff's). If you indicate this, then the proof is complete.

6.2.39: 0.5 / 2: Note that you do not use the inductive hypothesis in your proof. That's an indication that you either did something wrong or you did not need induction in the first place. Also note that what you label as the associative law is not how the associative law is written in theorem 6.2.2.

6.3.18: 2 / 2: The first power set is missing an element. Also, the delimiter in set notation is a comma, not a semi-colon.

6.3.37: 2 / 2

6.3.52: 2 / 2: The element method is not as painful as the algebraic approach.

7.1.3: 1.5 / 2: The instructions state to justify your answers.

7.1.27: 1 / 2: The range of f comes from considering all possible input values, not just the ones in the exercise. The range then is all non-negative integers. Same sort of comment for $g$.

## HW-9

Completion: 8 / 8
Total: 19 / 20

6.4.19: 1 / 2: In your 3rd bullet point, you can't deduce a truth value for the conclusion of a conditional with a false hypothesis. Argue this way: assume the conditional is false. The $p$ and not $q$. Therefore $p$. Therefore the sentence is true, contradition. Therefore the conditional is true, and it follows that $1 + 1 = 3$.

8.1.17: 1.5 / 2: This isn't quite a directed graph; see examples in Section 8.1.

11.3.12: 2 / 2

11.3.35: 2 / 2

11.4.38: 2 / 2: $\frac{4^n}{5^n} \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. This tells us that the quanity you derive after using the formula for geometric sums is $\theta(1)$.
